# whatshould

What should I __draw__?
What should I __write about__?
What should I __letter__?

This is a simple app for artists and writers to make a list of things they want to inspire them in google doc with 1 sheet and 1 column, and then be able to get a random choice on their phone, presented in a calm and encouraging, inspirational way.

The next features will be:
- to be able to randomly choose values from multiple columns (definitely)
- to use a pinboard as the source of inspirational (probably)
- save a bunch of different links to google docs or pinboards (probably)
- list of pre-curated list games (food, lemonopoly, & general art motifs)
- to be able to display multiple columns as 1 inspirational record (maybe, ex quote and author)
- to list several pinboards and choose randomly from all of them (maybe)
- to list several pinboards and pair 2 or 3 random images (maybe)
- maybe later use authorization to use private google docs on one's phone so they don't have to be published (maybe)
- allow images from full links via google doc (maybe)
- add a button that reloads the whole google doc
- way later: add in-app content entry (no google docs) (maybe)


### How to use it.
1. Create a google doc that lists things that inspire you. Make sure there is just 1 sheet and 1 column with all the information you want to display.
2. Publish your google doc to the web. 
3. Load up the app.
4. Paste the URL of the Google Doc into the app.
5. Refresh as desired.
6. You can edit your Google Doc and make sure the published version is updated.


### Why?
There is an abundance of inspiration. How do we pick what to doodle or draw when we actually have time to do so? Some people use google docs as a way to keep an ongoing list of ideas to remember when they feel like being creative. This might be a list of motifs, kinds of animals, quotes, or techniques to try. It's hard to pick a random item from a Google Doc, and also the google doc spreadsheet format isn't very pretty or calmly inspiring looking. 

There also is a cool game to generate ideas for making repeat patterns that requires 5 column types, so that's the real motivation behind this app. I orginally wrote eveything on little paper cards and put them in cups, but the cups were taking up a lot of space and still required a good 30 minutes of visual research on the internet, so looking to limit the inspiration phase to 5 minutes tops to leave more time and energy for drawing and sketching.


### Technology
The purpose of the technology choices for this app will be to play with some new JS frameworks.

Other technologies as they appear.
