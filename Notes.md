Everyone.

I made you the present of a tool. You each have a link to a "creative reminder" personalized prompt game.
Right now, the game accepts the first sheet of a public ("published to the web") google sheet, or a pinterest board.

I've created google sheets for you all & given you editor permissions. 

* You can do your own by making a google sheet & publishing it to the web. Then replace your link with the key I gave you with a key from a new google sheet that you create.
* The default behavior of the game is to group everything in a row together.
* To make the game draw a random item from a column instead of a row, include "use_columns" in the header. 
* The game accepts 10 columns. 
* If you paste a link to an image (ending in .jpg, .gif, .png, etc) a google sheet cell, it will render the image it 300px wide.

### Future Features as of August 4, 2015, 11 p.m.
Please let me know any features that would be pleasant for you. I intend to work on the design and layout - and eventually a form that will help you build URLs to your own projects that you can store yourself. I want to see how far this project can go without a database and without a login system. So far I'm quite pleased with google sheets & pinterest as the backend. One friend mentioned she would like to see her favorited tweets. This is a possibility. Also something integrated with some sort of list for "read it later" blog posts. I was thinking it would be nice to be re-presented with those reading materials again since 'save it later' means that I will never read it unless I find it again via Googling it.

### Games
If you think of games you can play with this that you want to share, we can use githubs wiki or issues or something to record and share them.
